### Context

#### Problem Statement

Football, more commonly known as soccer, is a team sport played between
two teams of 11 players who primarily use their feet to propel the ball
around a rectangular field called a pitch.

The FIFA ***World Cup Qatar*** 2022™ has been played from 20 November to
18 December. So basically its Soccer season. The excitement for football
is very high to everyone. In this workshop, we explore the soccer player
attributes. We explore single player attributes, compare 1 player
attributes to another and also see top n player attributes in the radar
plot.
